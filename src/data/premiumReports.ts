  solidRock: {
    introduction: "You are a Solid Rock, an anchor whose essence is stability and consistency. In a world of chaos, you provide a secure, predictable presence for those you love. Your deep desire is to create emotional safety, and you do this through unwavering reliability. You don't need grand gestures; your strength comes from the quiet, steady rhythm of a committed life.",
    
    howYouLove: "Your love is an act of grounded support, expressed primarily through Supportive Actions and Quality Presence. You show love by being dependable—you're the partner who texts when you land, who never forgets an anniversary, and who quietly handles the car maintenance without being asked. Your love is demonstrated through consistency: showing up on time, following through on promises, and being a rock in times of need. When you are with your partner, your presence is full and attentive, giving them a sense of peace and security.",
    
    whatYouNeed: "To feel loved, you need a sense of reliability and trust. You may worry about instability or letting others down, so a partner who follows through on their commitments is essential. You need to know that your quiet efforts are seen and appreciated. While you don't seek praise, a simple 'thank you' or acknowledgment of your hard work means the world. You feel most secure when you can relax and release your sense of responsibility, knowing you are in a safe and calm environment.",
    
    yourStrengths: "Your greatest strength is your ability to create an unshakeable foundation for a relationship. You are the emotional anchor who provides a sense of 'home.' Your loyalty is second to none, and you are a partner who is always in it for the long haul. You bring a calm, steady energy that can soothe your partner's anxieties and provide a sanctuary from life's stresses. Your pragmatism and sense of duty make you a trustworthy companion.",
    
    growthOpportunities: "Your greatest growth opportunity is to embrace flexibility and spontaneity. Your deep desire for predictability can sometimes make you rigid, and your focus on responsibility can make it difficult to let loose and enjoy life's unplanned moments. Learning to trust that your partner is reliable, and that not everything has to be perfect, can free you from self-imposed pressure. Practice letting go of control and allowing a little chaos into your life.",
    
    inConflict: "When you push for order, you're actually feeling anxious about this situation. Your default behavior is to try and control the external environment, but what you're really needing is a sense of calm.\n\nDe-escalation Script:\nYou: 'When I start to push for order, I'm actually feeling anxious about this. What I'm needing is a calm minute to think, then we can talk.'\nPartner: 'I hear you. I can give you some space now; let's check back in 15 minutes.'",
    
    adviceForPartners: "Do more of: Be reliable and consistent. Acknowledge their quiet contributions and show them you value their efforts.\n\nAvoid: Flaky behavior. Dismissing their need for a plan. Challenging their sense of integrity.\n\nTry this week: A 'cozy night in' where you plan a simple, predictable ritual together."

Your core motivation is to create security through strength and active advocacy. You don't just stand by; you take charge, step in, and defend what is yours. In a relationship, you are a fierce and loyal partner who leads with decisiveness and a direct, honest approach. Your loved ones know that with you, they are safe and looked after.",
    
    howYouLove: "Your love is an act of protection, expressed primarily through Supportive Actions and Physical Closeness. You show love by actively shielding your partner from harm. You're the person who steps in when you see injustice, handles difficult conversations, and provides a safe space for your partner to be vulnerable. Your love is also expressed through a powerful, reassuring presence and physical touch. A firm hug or a hand on the back is a non-verbal message that says, 'I've got you, and I won't let go.'",
    
    whatYouNeed: "You deeply value respect for your strength and loyalty. You may worry about being controlled or violated, so you need a partner who trusts you and allows you to lead in moments of conflict or uncertainty. You need a partner who can handle your intensity and who understands that your blunt honesty comes from a place of love and a desire for truth. While you are strong, you also have a tender side that needs a safe space to be seen. You need a partner who can be gentle and accepting, allowing you to let your guard down without judgment.",

    growthOpportunities: "Your greatest growth opportunity is learning to distinguish between what needs your protection and what needs your gentle presence.

Learning to express your feelings and vulnerabilities without fear will help you connect on a deeper level.",
    
    inConflict: "When you become pushy, you're really feeling scared or vulnerable. Your default behavior is to take control, but what you're really needing is for your partner to acknowledge your fear.\n\nDe-escalation Script:\nYou: 'When I start to take control, I'm actually feeling scared. What I'm needing is for you to listen to me for a minute and acknowledge my perspective.'\nPartner: 'I hear you. I can do that now; let's check back in 15 minutes.'",

    whatYouNeed: "To feel loved, you need to be appreciated and valued for who you are, not just what you do. When you feel a lack of care or appreciation, you may begin to feel resentful or taken for granted. While you are a natural caregiver, you need a partner who also cares for you, giving you permission to rest and be nurtured in return. You may worry that if you put yourself first, your partner will no longer need you.",
    
    yourStrengths: "Your greatest strength is your immense capacity for empathy and care.

You must also learn that your worth is not dependent on your ability to care for others.",
    
    inConflict: "When you withdraw, you're actually feeling overwhelmed and unseen. Your default behavior is to become passive-aggressive or people-pleasing, trying to make the conflict go away by giving in to your partner's demands. What you're really needing is to feel a sense of security and appreciation.\n\nDe-escalation Script:\nYou: 'When I start to give in, it's because I'm feeling overwhelmed and trying to avoid conflict. What I'm needing is for you to tell me that my feelings matter.'\nPartner: 'I hear you. I can do that now; let's revisit this when we're both calm.'",
    
    adviceForPartners: "Do more of: Show them that they are seen and appreciated. Express genuine gratitude for their efforts.

You create a supportive and emotionally safe environment where both of you can thrive.",
    
    growthOpportunities: "Your greatest growth opportunity is to learn that actions can speak louder than words. Your tendency to use language as your primary tool for connection can sometimes overshadow your need to simply 'be.' You may also rely too heavily on verbal communication and struggle to understand a partner who expresses love through other means, such as touch or acts of service. To grow, you must practice a quieter form of love and learn to appreciate non-verbal expressions of care.",
    
    inConflict: "When you over-explain, you're feeling a fear of being misunderstood. Your default behavior is to talk through every detail, but what you're really needing is for your partner to listen.\n\nDe-escalation Script:\nYou: 'When I start to talk through every detail, I'm actually feeling anxious about this. What would help is for you to just sit with me for a few quiet minutes.'\nPartner: 'I hear you. I can do that now; let's revisit the conversation when you're ready.'",

To grow, you must practice finding joy in the mundane and to appreciate the lightness and ease of a simple, fun connection.",
    
    inConflict: "When you withdraw, you're feeling a fear of being misunderstood and are trying to protect yourself. Your default behavior is to retreat into yourself to process your feelings. What you're really needing is for your partner to give you space but also to check in on you.\n\nDe-escalation Script:\nYou: 'When I get quiet, it's because I'm feeling overwhelmed and need to process. What would help is if you could give me a little space, and I'll come back to you when I'm ready to talk.'\nPartner: 'I hear you. I can give you space now; let's check back in 15 minutes.'",
