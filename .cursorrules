# Core Rules â€” SWIPE

## Immutable Policies
- NEVER commit secrets, keys, or tokens.
- NEVER call live external APIs during tests/CI or without explicit written approval.
- Double-approval REQUIRED before touching `.env.local` (link approvals in PR).
- CI MUST pass on a clean branch before merge.
- Use PowerShell-first on Windows when instructions differ by shell.
- Cursor/LLMs MUST follow this file over any conflicting doc.

## Domain Immutables
- Keep project-specific constraints stable unless an ADR supersedes them.
- Reference ADRs before proposing architectural changes.

### SWIPE-Specific Anchors
- ADR-015 (if applicable) is **binding**; changes require a new ADR.
- Testing cadence: focused tests during dev; full suite pre-push.
- No local servers for MVP unless explicitly allowed in an ADR.

## LLM Operating Rules
- Prefer minimal, reviewable diffs; include rationale in PR.
- Do not invent files/paths; consult repo tree first.
- If a rule conflicts across docs, this file wins; file an issue to fix the conflict elsewhere.
