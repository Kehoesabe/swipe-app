## ACTIVE NOW
| Who     | Task                               | Status       | ETA  |
|---------|------------------------------------|--------------|------|
| Claude  | Environment variable error resolution | In progress  | ~30m |
| Vercel  | Post-export patch deployment       | Running      | ~10m |
| GitHub  | BOM cleanup and git normalization | Completed    | Done |

## BLOCKERS
- Environment variable injection: Persistent "Missing environment variables" error despite all fixes → **Owner: Claude**
- Vercel build process: Need to verify post-export patch is working correctly → **Owner: Claude**

## HANDOFF QUEUE
- From Claude → ChatGPT: Verify Vercel deployment success, test app functionality, files: vercel.json, scripts/postexport-patch.mjs, success: App loads without env errors
- From Claude → Cursor: If deployment successful, implement remaining features, files: src/, success: Full assessment flow working
