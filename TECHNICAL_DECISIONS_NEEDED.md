# Technical Decisions Needed - Swipe Analytics Platform

## ðŸŽ¯ **Critical Decisions Required**

### **1. Database Architecture**
**Decision Needed**: How should we handle data storage?
- **Local SQLite** (Expo SQLite) - Fast development, easy migration
- **Cloud Database** (Firebase, Supabase, AWS) - Production-ready, scalable
- **Hybrid Approach** - Local for dev, cloud for production

**Impact**: Affects development speed, scalability, and migration complexity.

### **2. Backend Strategy**
**Decision Needed**: What backend approach should we use?
- **Serverless** (Firebase Functions, Vercel Functions) - No server management
- **Traditional Server** (Node.js + Express) - Full control, custom logic
- **BaaS** (Backend as a Service) - Firebase, Supabase - Rapid development

**Impact**: Affects development time, scalability, and maintenance complexity.

### **3. User Authentication**
**Decision Needed**: How should we handle user authentication?
- **Simple JWT** - Custom implementation, full control
- **Firebase Auth** - Managed service, social login
- **Third-party Auth** - Auth0, Clerk - Enterprise features

**Impact**: Affects security, user experience, and development time.

### **4. AI Content Generation**
**Decision Needed**: What AI service should we use?
- **OpenAI API** - GPT models, content generation
- **Anthropic Claude** - Alternative AI provider
- **Multiple Providers** - Fallback options, cost optimization
- **Custom Models** - Self-hosted, data privacy

**Impact**: Affects content quality, costs, and data privacy.

### **5. Analytics & Reporting**
**Decision Needed**: What analytics approach should we use?
- **Basic Charts** (Chart.js, Recharts) - Simple, fast
- **Advanced Analytics** (D3.js, custom) - Complex visualizations
- **Third-party Analytics** (Mixpanel, Amplitude) - Managed service
- **Custom Analytics** - Full control, specific requirements

**Impact**: Affects insights quality, development time, and user experience.

### **6. Development Environment**
**Decision Needed**: What development approach should we use?
- **Local Development** - SQLite, local testing
- **Cloud Development** - Firebase, Supabase from start
- **Hybrid Development** - Local for dev, cloud for staging

**Impact**: Affects development speed, costs, and team collaboration.

### **7. Testing Strategy**
**Decision Needed**: What testing approach should we use?
- **Manual Testing** - Fast MVP, human validation
- **Unit Testing** - Jest, automated testing
- **Integration Testing** - End-to-end testing
- **Comprehensive Testing** - All testing types

**Impact**: Affects code quality, development time, and maintenance.

### **8. Deployment Strategy**
**Decision Needed**: How should we deploy the application?
- **Expo EAS** - Managed mobile deployment
- **Custom Deployment** - Vercel, Netlify, AWS
- **Hybrid Deployment** - Different strategies for different platforms

**Impact**: Affects deployment complexity, costs, and maintenance.

### **9. Data Privacy & Security**
**Decision Needed**: What privacy and security measures should we implement?
- **Basic Security** - Simple authentication, basic encryption
- **GDPR Compliance** - Data protection, user rights
- **Enterprise Security** - Advanced encryption, audit logs

**Impact**: Affects compliance, user trust, and legal requirements.

### **10. Business Model Implementation**
**Decision Needed**: How should we implement the business model?
- **SaaS Model** - Monthly subscriptions
- **Usage-based Pricing** - Per-user, per-question
- **Enterprise Packages** - Custom pricing, features
- **Freemium Model** - Free tier, premium features

**Impact**: Affects revenue, user acquisition, and feature development.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Decisions for MVP**

### **Phase 1: MVP Decisions**
1. **Database**: SQLite for local development, PostgreSQL for production
2. **Backend**: Node.js + Express for full control
3. **Authentication**: Simple JWT for MVP, Firebase Auth for production
4. **AI**: OpenAI API for content generation
5. **Analytics**: Chart.js for basic charts
6. **Development**: Local development with cloud migration
7. **Testing**: Manual testing for MVP, automated testing later
8. **Deployment**: Expo EAS for mobile, Vercel for web
9. **Security**: Basic security for MVP, enhanced security later
10. **Business Model**: SaaS model with monthly subscriptions

### **Phase 2: Production Decisions**
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
2. **Backend**: Microservices architecture
3. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with social login
4. **AI**: Multiple AI providers with fallback
5. **Analytics**: Advanced analytics with D3.js
6. **Development**: Cloud-first development
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite
8. **Deployment**: Kubernetes with CI/CD
9. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
10. **Business Model**: Multiple pricing tiers with enterprise features

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Review and approve** the recommended decisions
2. **Set up development environment** with chosen technologies
3. **Create database schema** for the MVP
4. **Build admin interface** for content management
5. **Implement user authentication** system

### **Questions for Review**
1. Do you agree with the recommended MVP decisions?
2. Are there any specific requirements that change these recommendations?
3. What's the timeline for MVP completion?
4. Are there any budget constraints that affect technology choices?
5. Do you have any preferences for specific technologies or services?
