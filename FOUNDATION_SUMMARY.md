## üöÄ Getting Started with Your Foundation

### For Human Developers

1. **Read these first:**
   - `README.md` - Get the big picture
   - `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - For daily tasks
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - For workflow

2. **Reference when needed:**
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - For design decisions
   - `TESTING.md` - When writing tests
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - When deploying

3. **Keep updated:**
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - After each release
   - `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` - As requirements evolve

### For AI Assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

**Initial Context Loading:**
```
Load these files for context:
1. .cursorrules (REQUIRED - core patterns)
2. AGENTS.md (avoid common mistakes)
3. ARCHITECTURE.md (understand structure)
4. QUICK_REFERENCE.md (common patterns)
```

**Task-Specific Context:**
- **Writing components**: `.cursorrules` + `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- **Writing tests**: `TESTING.md` + `AGENTS.md`
- **Architecture changes**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- **Security features**: `SECURITY.md` + `.cursorrules`

## Model Configuration & AI Roles (Oct 2025)

- **Cursor (execution):** **Claude 4.5 Sonnet only** for all in-IDE edits and diffs. No autonomous terminal agents.  
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5):** Architecture, full-file builds, documentation, rare PowerShell (explicit approval only).  
- **Claude (Browser, 4.5):** Reviewer/advisor‚Äîimproves logic, stops loops, suggests corrections.  
- **Protected Files:** `.env.local`, `.env`, `package.json`, `app.json` / `app.config.ts` require double approval.  
- **Handoffs:** New chat or project switch requires a handoff doc in `/handoffs/`.

This configuration optimizes for **consistency, safety, and accountability** while preserving speed via Cursor diffs and SAF‚Äôs TDD cadence.


## üìö How to Use Each Document

### Daily Development Flow

```
Morning:
‚îú‚îÄ Check QUICK_REFERENCE.md for syntax
‚îú‚îÄ Review open tasks in PROJECT_BRIEF.md
‚îî‚îÄ Start coding with .cursorrules active

During Development:
‚îú‚îÄ Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for patterns
‚îú‚îÄ Check AGENTS.md if using AI assistants
‚îî‚îÄ Write tests following TESTING.md

Before Committing:
‚îú‚îÄ Run npm run lint
‚îú‚îÄ Run npm test
‚îú‚îÄ Check CONTRIBUTING.md for commit format
‚îî‚îÄ Update CHANGELOG.md if needed

Deploying:
‚îî‚îÄ Follow DEPLOYMENT.md procedures
```

### AI Assistant Workflow

**Starting a new feature with AI:**
```
1. You: "I need to add user profile editing"
2. AI reads: .cursorrules, ARCHITECTURE.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md
3. AI suggests: Component structure following patterns
4. You: Review and accept
5. AI generates: Type-safe, tested code
```

**Debugging with AI:**
```
1. You: "Why is navigation crashing?"
2. AI checks: AGENTS.md for common mistakes
3. AI reviews: Navigation patterns in ARCHITECTURE.md
4. AI suggests: Fix with explanation
```

1. README.md
2. QUICK_REFERENCE.md
3. CONTRIBUTING.md
4. Then others as needed

### "How do I use .cursorrules?"
Just have it in your project root. Cursor IDE automatically loads it.

### "Do I need to memorize all this?"
No! Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md as a cheat sheet. Documentation is for reference, not memorization.

### "Can I modify these docs?"
Absolutely! These are templates. Adapt them to your specific needs.

### "What if I disagree with a pattern?"
Discuss with the team, update the docs, and ensure everyone follows the new pattern.
