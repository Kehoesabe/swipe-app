## ü§î **Critical Questions Needing Answers**

### **1. Database & Backend Architecture**
**Question**: What's the preferred approach for data storage and API?
- **Option A**: Start with local SQLite (Expo SQLite) for MVP, migrate to cloud later
- **Option B**: Direct cloud database (Firebase, Supabase, AWS) from day one
- **Option C**: Hybrid - local for development, cloud for production

**My Recommendation**: Option A for rapid MVP development, then migrate to cloud database.

### **2. User Authentication & Management**
**Question**: How should we handle user accounts initially?
- **Option A**: Simple local user storage (username/password in SQLite)
- **Option B**: Firebase Auth integration
- **Option C**: Custom JWT-based auth system

**My Recommendation**: Option A for MVP, then migrate to Firebase Auth for production.

### **3. Content Management System**
**Question**: How should we store and manage questions/statements?
- **Option A**: JSON files with admin interface
- **Option B**: Database with admin CRUD operations
- **Option C**: Hybrid - JSON for development, database for production

**My Recommendation**: Option B - Database from start for scalability.

### **4. Analytics & Reporting**
**Question**: What level of analytics do you want initially?
- **Option A**: Basic counts and percentages
- **Option B**: Advanced analytics with charts and trends
- **Option C**: Real-time dashboards with live updates

**My Recommendation**: Option A for MVP, then build to Option C.

### **5. AI Content Generation**

- **Option D**: Multiple AI providers with fallback

**My Recommendation**: Option A (OpenAI API) for MVP, then expand to Option D.

### **6. Development Environment**
**Question**: What's the preferred development approach?
- **Option A**: Local development with SQLite, deploy to cloud
- **Option B**: Cloud-first development with Firebase/Supabase
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with local testing, cloud production

**My Recommendation**: Option A for rapid iteration and cost control.

### **7. User Experience & Interface**
**Question**: What's the priority for user interface development?
- **Option A**: Mobile-first (React Native app)
- **Option B**: Web-first (React web app)
- **Option C**: Both equally (responsive design)

**My Recommendation**: Option A (Mobile-first) since swipe is inherently mobile.

### **8. Testing Strategy**
**Question**: What's the preferred testing approach?
- **Option A**: Manual testing for MVP, automated testing later
- **Option B**: Unit tests + integration tests from start
- **Option C**: End-to-end testing with automated tools

**My Recommendation**: Option A for MVP speed, then build to Option B.

### **9. Data Privacy & Compliance**
**Question**: What are the privacy requirements?
- **Option A**: Basic data collection, minimal privacy controls
