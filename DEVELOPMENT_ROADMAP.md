# Swipe Analytics Platform - Development Roadmap

## üéØ **Current Status**
- ‚úÖ Core swipe functionality (4-directional voting)
- ‚úÖ Basic analytics tracking
- ‚úÖ Question/statement display system
- ‚úÖ Results table with per-question tracking

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions Needed**

### **1. Database & Backend Strategy**
**Question**: What's your preference for data storage and API?
- **Option A**: Start with local SQLite (Expo SQLite) for MVP, migrate to cloud later
- **Option B**: Direct cloud database (Firebase, Supabase, AWS) from day one
- **Option C**: Hybrid - local for development, cloud for production

**My Recommendation**: Option A for rapid MVP development, then migrate to cloud database.

### **2. User Authentication & Management**
**Question**: How should we handle user accounts initially?
- **Option A**: Simple local user storage (username/password in SQLite)
- **Option B**: Firebase Auth integration
- **Option C**: Custom JWT-based auth system

**My Recommendation**: Option A for MVP, then migrate to Firebase Auth for production.

### **3. Content Management System**
**Question**: How should we store and manage questions/statements?
- **Option A**: JSON files with admin interface
- **Option B**: Database with admin CRUD operations
- **Option C**: Hybrid - JSON for development, database for production

**My Recommendation**: Option B - Database from start for scalability.

### **4. Analytics & Reporting**
**Question**: What level of analytics do you want initially?
- **Option A**: Basic counts and percentages
- **Option B**: Advanced analytics with charts and trends
- **Option C**: Real-time dashboards with live updates

**My Recommendation**: Option A for MVP, then build to Option C.

## üöÄ **Proposed Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Platform Enhancement (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] Database setup (SQLite ‚Üí Cloud migration path)
- [ ] User management system (single admin user)
- [ ] Content management (CRUD for questions/statements)
- [ ] Enhanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Question categories and filtering

### **Phase 2: Multi-User System (Week 3-4)**
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] User profiles and avatars
- [ ] Question exposure tracking (one-time per user)
- [ ] Topic switching functionality

### **Phase 3: AI Content Generation (Week 5-6)**
- [ ] AI integration (OpenAI API)
- [ ] Content generation prompts
- [ ] Content calendar system
- [ ] Automated question scheduling
- [ ] Content quality validation

### **Phase 4: Advanced Analytics (Week 7-8)**
- [ ] Predictive modeling
- [ ] Sentiment analysis
- [ ] Business intelligence dashboards
- [ ] Client reporting system
- [ ] Data export capabilities

## ü§î **Key Technical Questions**

### **1. Technology Stack Preferences**
- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo (current) ‚úÖ
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express, or Python + FastAPI, or serverless?
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase?
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, or custom models?

### **2. Development Environment**
- **Local Development**: Should we set up local database first?
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, or manual testing?
- **Deployment**: Expo EAS, or custom deployment?

### **3. Data Architecture**
- **User Data**: What user information do we need to collect?
- **Analytics Data**: How granular should our tracking be?
- **Content Data**: How should we structure questions/statements?

## üí° **My Recommendations**

### **Start with These Decisions:**
1. **Database**: SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL for production
2. **Backend**: Node.js + Express for API
3. **Authentication**: Simple JWT for MVP, Firebase Auth for production
4. **AI**: OpenAI API for content generation
5. **Analytics**: Basic charts with Chart.js or similar

### **Development Approach:**
1. **Week 1**: Set up database and basic CRUD operations
2. **Week 2**: Build admin interface for content management
3. **Week 3**: Add user authentication and profiles
4. **Week 4**: Implement AI content generation
5. **Week 5**: Build analytics dashboards
6. **Week 6**: Add advanced features and testing

## üéØ **Next Steps**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Set up database schema
2. Create admin interface for content management
3. Build user authentication system
4. Implement question exposure tracking
5. Add analytics dashboard

**Questions for You:**
1. What's your preferred database solution?
2. Should we start with local development or cloud-first?
3. What level of analytics do you want in the MVP?
4. Any specific AI models or services you prefer?
5. Timeline expectations for MVP completion?
