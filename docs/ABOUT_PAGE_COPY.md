# About Swipe Type

## Our Story
We built Swipe Type to make self-understanding fast, friendly, and actually useful.  
If you've ever wondered, "Why do my relationships keep following the same script?"—you're not alone. We saw people bounce between dense personality tests and vague advice that didn't translate into daily choices. So we combined research-informed frameworks with a 3-minute, swipe-based experience that meets you where you are.

Our mission is simple: **help you name your pattern so you can change it**—with practical steps you can use tonight.

## The Science Behind It
**Connection Styles (6):** How you feel cared for and how you tend to show care (e.g., Verbal Affirmation, Quality Presence, Physical Closeness, Supportive Actions, Thoughtful Gestures, Shared Growth).

**Enneagram Types (9):** Nine archetypal motivations and coping strategies that influence your attention, habits, and defenses.

We measure both—then map your combined pattern to one of **8 Swipe Types**. Each type blends the "how I connect" (Connection Style) with "why I do it that way" (Enneagram lens).

**How we build the model:**
- Clear, behavioral questions (57 items) with forced choices  
- Randomized order and reverse-coded items to reduce bias  
- Item-level and scale-level reliability checks (e.g., Cronbach's α)  
- Validation pilots and continuous improvement from real usage data
