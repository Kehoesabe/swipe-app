# Couples Report Structure (DST)

## Purpose
Turn two individual Swipe Type results into a practical, shared playbook. The report should feel hopeful, specific, and usable tonight.

---

## Report Sections (8)

1) **Cover & Snapshot (1 page)**
- Pair name (e.g., Solid Rock × Free Spirit)
- Rating badge (High/Balanced/Growth/Challenging)
- 2–3 sentence core dynamic
- Type chips with colors/motifs

2) **How You Click**
- 3–5 bullet "why this works"
- Axis diagram: stability ↔ energy; relational depth ↔ self-expression
- Highlight complementary instincts

3) **Where It Snags**
- Top 3 friction points (plain language)
- Example moments ("It sounds like…")
- Early warning signs

4) **Conflict Loop & Repair**
- Your default loop: trigger → escalation → protection/withdrawal → impasse
- Repair scripts (brief, non-clinical)
- De-escalation choices by type (e.g., WG takes time-out; DC asks for feelings word)

5) **What Each Person Needs**
- Partner A needs (3 bullets)
- Partner B needs (3 bullets)
- "What to do tonight" micro-habits (1 per partner)

6) **Rituals & Routines**
- 3 rituals (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- 1 five-minute daily practice
- Optional "adventure" prompt if FS/PP present

7) **Communication Guide**
- Phrases that land (by pair)
- Phrases to avoid (by pair)
- One shared boundary and one repair agreement

8) **Make It Yours**
- Blend notes if either primary margin < 0.20
- Editable plan template (goals, roles, dates)
- Link back to individual reports

## Tone Guidelines
- Warm, empowering, gender-neutral
- Actionable > abstract; scripts > theory
- 8th–10th grade reading level
- Avoid pathology; emphasize choice and practice

---

## Visual System
- Pair color = average of type accents (keep accessible contrast)
- Motifs: display both; overlap subtly when "High"
- Badges: High / Balanced / Growth / Challenging with succinct tooltips

---

## Personalization Hooks
- Pull top three subscales from each partner to tailor scripts
- If reverse-item pattern implies sensitivity to tone, substitute gentler phrasing
- If "onboarding_easy" items skewed strongly, simplify early guidance

## Example Snippet — SR × FS (abbrev)

**Core Dynamic:** A stable base meets refreshing spontaneity. When you plan small windows for play, spark thrives without stress.

**Your Loop:** SR worries about logistics → FS pivots last-minute → SR tightens control → FS resists.  
**Repair Script:**  
- SR: "I want fun *and* calm. Can we lock a 2-hour window?"  
- FS: "Yes. I'll pick 2 surprises by 6pm and confirm."

**Ritual:** Sunday "Adventure Window" on calendar; FS curates options; SR confirms timing.

**Phrases that land:**  
- SR to FS: "Pick the vibe; I'll make it easy to say yes."  
- FS to SR: "Here are my top 2, both within our plan."

## Integration Points (DST)
- Inputs: primary & (optional) secondary types + subscale means
- Engine: use couples matrix + heuristics to pick rating, tips, scripts, and rituals
- Output: JSON blocks per section → rendered in app/web PDF
- Analytics: track section opens and copied scripts for iteration

---

## How It Differs from Individual Reports
- Two-person focus (loops, scripts, rituals)
- Side-by-side needs
- Shared agreements and calendars
- Visual pair identity (dual motifs, combined accent)
