# Swipe Type — Landing Page Copy

> Notes for implementation:
> - Keep copy scannable with short paragraphs and clear subheads.
> - Use large, legible type on mobile. Primary CTA appears above the fold and repeats mid-page and footer.
> - Replace all square-bracket placeholders with real assets (hero image/video, testimonial names, logos).
> - Keep price in sync with Stripe via config. Copy currently references **$12** (corrected from $19.97).

## PROBLEM / AGITATION

**Section title:** Why do my relationships feel the same?  
**Body:**  
Maybe you keep dating the same kind of person—or having the same fights with the partner you love. You're not broken. You have patterns. When you can name them, you can change them.  
Common roadblocks we hear:
- Misreads and mixed signals during tough conversations  
- Feeling close one week and distant the next  
- Trying to show love in ways your partner doesn't feel  
- Repeating arguments without real resolution
