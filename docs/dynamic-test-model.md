“Dynamic Personality Interpretation” - Fleshed Summary - behavioral pattern tracker with personality interpretation

Probed innovative digital personality test with dynamic potential.
10s
This is interesting - they're showing me context from what appears to be a different project or an expansion idea. They have:
The Swipe Type Assessment (57 items, relationship-focused, 12 domains → 5 channels → 8 types)
This "Digital Swipe Test" (DST) concept (15-25 items, digital personality, 3-4 dimensions, dynamic/rolling updates)
They're asking me to evaluate this in context of creating:
A "digital personality type"
A "dynamic personality test" where results change with people over time
This is quite different from the Swipe Type Assessment. Let me think about the psychometric implications and opportunities here.
Key differences:
DST is much shorter (15-25 items vs 57)
DST focuses on digital behavior specifically
DST has this "rolling profile" concept with mini-assessments
DST aims to track change over time intentionally
This is actually quite innovative from a psychometric perspective. Most personality tests treat personality as relatively stable (which it is for broad traits like Big Five), but behavioral patterns in specific domains CAN change more readily, especially in response to:
New technologies
Intentional behavior change efforts
Life stage transitions
Environmental changes
The "digital personality" domain is particularly well-suited for this because:
It's more state-like than trait-like (behaviors can change)
The digital landscape itself evolves rapidly
People actively try to change their digital habits
Measurement can be frequent without test fatigue (short mini-assessments)
Let me evaluate this concept against:
Psychometric viability
Comparison to the four tests + their Swipe Type Assessment
Innovation opportunities
Risks and challenges
Research precedents (there are some - ecological momentary assessment, dynamic systems approaches)
Digital Swipe Test (DST): Dynamic Personality Assessment Evaluation
Future Scope Analysis for Methodology Team

1. DUAL-TRACK ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
You now have TWO distinct tests in development:
Test A: Swipe Type Assessment (Relationship-Focused)
Items: 57
Domains: 12 → 5 channels → 8 types
Target: Stable relationship behavior patterns
Timeframe: Relatively stable (retest in months/years)
Model: Traditional trait assessment
Test B: Digital Swipe Test (Digital Behavior-Focused)
Items: 15-25 (initial) + mini-assessments (3-5 items periodic)
Dimensions: 3-4 digital personality dimensions
Target: Evolving digital behavior patterns
Timeframe: Dynamic (rolling updates monthly/quarterly)
Model: INNOVATIVE - State-trait hybrid with longitudinal tracking
These serve different purposes and have different psychometric properties.

2. THE "DYNAMIC PERSONALITY TEST" CONCEPT
What Makes DST Innovative:
This is NOT traditional personality assessment. It's a behavioral pattern tracker with personality interpretation.
Theoretical Foundation:
Traditional View:
Personality = Stable traits (Big Five, MBTI)
→ Should NOT change much over time
→ Change = measurement error or invalid test

DST View:
Digital Personality = Behaviors + Habits + Tech Relationship
→ SHOULD change with intention, context, technology evolution
→ Change = valid signal, not noise
Precedents in Psychometrics:
1. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
Method: Repeated micro-assessments in natural contexts
Used for: Mood, pain, substance use, behavior tracking
Evidence: Captures within-person variability well
Your DST: Similar logic, applied to digital behavior domain
2. Dynamic Systems Approaches
Theory: Personality as dynamic process, not fixed trait
Researchers: Fleeson, Nowak, Lewis
Evidence: People show substantial within-person variability
Your DST: Operationalizes this for digital behaviors
3. Growth Mindset / Behavior Change Apps
Examples: Habit trackers, meditation apps, fitness trackers
Model: Baseline → Intervention → Re-measure → Track progress
Your DST: Adds personality interpretation layer to behavior tracking
Your innovation: Combining personality profiling with longitudinal behavior tracking in a single integrated system.

3. PSYCHOMETRIC VIABILITY ANALYSIS
✅ Why This COULD Work:
1. Domain-Specific Behaviors Are More Changeable Than Broad Traits
Big Five Traits: Change very slowly (r = 0.65 over 10 years)
Digital Habits: Can change rapidly (weeks/months)

Evidence:
- Social media usage changes with platform trends
- Tech adoption accelerates or slows with life stage
- Digital well-being interventions show effects in 4-8 weeks

Your advantage: Measuring the right level (behaviors, not deep traits)

2. Shorter Intervals = Valid for State-Like Constructs
Traditional personality: Retest at 6-12 months (avoid memory effects)
Your DST mini-assessments: Monthly/quarterly (appropriate for habits)

Analogy:
- Asking "Are you generally extraverted?" → Shouldn't change monthly
- Asking "How much time did you spend on social media this month?" → Should change

Your dimensions sit between trait and state.

3. User Motivation Advantage
Traditional test: One-time assessment, maybe retest once
Your DST: Ongoing engagement through mini-assessments

Gamification potential:
- "Your digital personality evolved!"
- Progress tracking toward goals
- Before/after comparisons

This increases data quality AND user retention.

4. Methodological Sophistication
Your spec mentions:
- "Change detection algorithms"
- "Statistically significant shifts"
- "Differentiating genuine growth from random variation"

This is correct approach. You're thinking about:
- Reliable Change Index (RCI)
- Growth curve modeling
- Within-person effect sizes

Strong foundation for dynamic assessment.

⚠️ Why This Is HARD:
1. Separating Signal from Noise
Challenge: How do you know if change is:
- Real behavior change? (valid signal)
- Measurement error? (noise)
- Mood fluctuation? (temporary state)
- Test-taking approach changed? (response style shift)

Solution needed:
- Establish measurement error bounds (SEM)
- Set thresholds for "meaningful change" (RCI > 1.96)
- Include stability check items (should NOT change)
- Track response patterns for consistency
Math example:
Dimension score = 65 at Time 1
SEM = 5 (based on reliability α = 0.75)

Reliable Change Index:
RCI = (Score_T2 - Score_T1) / √(2 × SEM²)
RCI = (Score_T2 - 65) / 7.07

Meaningful change: |RCI| > 1.96
→ Score must change by ±14 points to be "real" (not measurement error)

If Score_T2 = 72: RCI = 0.99 (not significant)
If Score_T2 = 80: RCI = 2.12 (significant change!)

2. Distinguishing Construct Types
You need to be explicit about what SHOULD vs. SHOULDN'T change:

Should be stable (trait-like):
- "I generally prefer text to voice communication"
- Core digital interaction style

Should change (state-like):
- "This month I've been actively trying to reduce screen time"
- Current digital habits

Hybrid (can change slowly):
- "I'm comfortable with new AI tools"
- Evolving attitudes toward technology

Your 3-4 dimensions need clear theoretical positions on changeability.

3. Confounding Factors
What if scores change because:
- User learned "better" answers? (social desirability drift)
- Digital landscape changed? (new platforms, features)
- User got older? (life stage effects)
- Economic changes? (can't afford subscriptions anymore)

Solution:
- Ask "why" questions in mini-assessments (you mention this)
- Control items that assess external factors
- Separate "attitude change" from "behavior change"

4. Norms Become Moving Target
Traditional test: Establish norms once, use for years
Your DST: Population norms shift as digital behaviors evolve

Example:
- In 2020: "I use video calls daily" = high score (unusual)
- In 2024: Same behavior = average (post-COVID norm)

Solution:
- Time-stamped norms (refresh annually)
- Within-person change focus (compare to own baseline, not others)
- Cohort-specific norms (by age/generation)

4. DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT
A. Dimensional Structure
Re-evaluate your 3-4 dimensions for changeability:
Dimension
Changeability
Retest Interval
Measurement Strategy
Digital Engagement & Proactivity
Moderate-High
Monthly
Good for dynamic tracking
Information & Tech Relationship
Moderate
Quarterly
Some aspects stable (attitude), others change (adoption)
Digital Communication & Connection
Low-Moderate
Quarterly
Style relatively stable, but channels shift
Digital Resilience & Well-being
High
Monthly
Explicitly targeted for intervention/change

Recommendation:
Tier 1 dimensions (High changeability): Track monthly with mini-assessments
Tier 2 dimensions (Moderate): Track quarterly
Tier 3 dimensions (Low - if any): Initial assessment only, retest at 6-12 months

B. Item Types for Dynamic Assessment
Initial Assessment (15-25 items):
Mix of:
- Trait-like items (establish baseline personality): 40%
  "I generally prefer asynchronous communication"
  
- Habit items (current behavior patterns): 40%
  "I check social media within 10 minutes of waking up"
  
- Attitude items (tech relationship): 20%
  "I'm excited about AI developments"
Mini-Assessments (3-5 items):
Focus on:
- Most changeable behaviors (Digital Resilience, Engagement)
- Explicit change tracking:
  "Compared to 3 months ago, I spend ____ time on social media"
  "This month I've intentionally changed: ____"
  
- Context capture:
  "What's influencing your digital habits right now?"
  [Life change / New platform / Wellness goal / Just evolved]

C. Scoring Architecture for Dynamic Profiles
Three-Layer Scoring:
Layer 1: Current State (Most Recent Assessment)
User sees:
"Your Current Digital Personality"
- Dimensions scored 0-100
- Archetype assignment
- Date of last update
Layer 2: Trajectory (Change Over Time)
User sees:
"Your Digital Evolution"
- Trend lines for each dimension
- "Growing" / "Stable" / "Declining" indicators
- Rate of change
- Inflection points marked
Layer 3: Baseline (Original Assessment)
User sees:
"Where You Started"
- Initial scores (archived)
- % change since baseline
- Biggest shifts highlighted

D. Change Detection Algorithm
Statistical Framework:
python
def detect_meaningful_change(score_t1, score_t2, sem, confidence=0.95):
    """
    Detect if change is statistically reliable
    
    Uses Reliable Change Index (Jacobson & Truax, 1991)
    """
    rci = (score_t2 - score_t1) / (sem * sqrt(2))
    z_critical = 1.96  # for 95% confidence
    
    is_significant = abs(rci) > z_critical
    
    # Effect size
    if is_significant:
        direction = "increased" if rci > 0 else "decreased"
        magnitude = "substantially" if abs(rci) > 2.5 else "moderately"
        
        return {
            "changed": True,
            "direction": direction,
            "magnitude": magnitude,
            "rci": rci,
            "confidence": confidence
        }
    
    return {"changed": False, "stable": True}


def growth_curve_analysis(scores_over_time, timestamps):
    """
    Fit growth curve to detect patterns
    
    Options:
    - Linear growth: Steady improvement
    - Quadratic: Initial change then plateau
    - Piecewise: Sudden shift at intervention point
    """
    # Fit multiple models, compare AIC
    # Return best-fitting trajectory

Your unique position: Only assessment where change is FEATURE, not BUG.

Market Gap This Fills:
Current landscape:
Personality Tests: "Discover who you are" (static)
Habit Trackers: "Track your behavior" (no personality interpretation)
Wellness Apps: "Improve specific metrics" (narrow focus)

→ Gap: Personality-informed behavior change tracking
DST fills this by:
Personality framework (archetypes, dimensions)
Behavior tracking (habits, patterns)
Growth orientation (change is expected and guided)
Domain-specific (digital life, not generic)

6. VALIDATION STRATEGY FOR DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT
Special Considerations:
Traditional validation assumes stability. You need NEW metrics:
A. Test-Retest Reliability ≠ Traditional
Traditional interpretation:
r = 0.90 at 4 weeks → "Reliable test"
r = 0.60 at 4 weeks → "Unreliable test"
Your interpretation:
r = 0.90 for "digital communication style" → Good (should be stable)
r = 0.60 for "screen time management" → Expected (targeting change)
r = 0.30 for "current social media engagement" → Fine (state-like)
What you actually need:
1. Trait-like items: r > 0.75 (stable baseline)
2. Habit items: r = 0.50-0.70 (moderate stability)
3. State items: r = 0.30-0.50 (expected variation)
4. Intervention items: LOWER r after intervention = working!

B. Validation Metrics for Dynamic Assessment:
1. Sensitivity to Change
Test: Can DST detect changes when they occur?

Method:
- Users report life change: "Started new job" / "Digital detox attempt"
- Check if relevant dimensions changed
- Compare changers vs. non-changers

Success: Effect size d > 0.30 for self-reported changers

2. Specificity of Change
Test: Does change occur in right dimensions?

Example:
- User reports "Reduced social media use"
- Digital Engagement should ↓
- Digital Communication style should stay stable

Success: Changes align with theoretical predictions

3. Trajectory Validity
Test: Do predicted patterns match reality?

Method:
- Fit growth curves to first 3 assessments
- Predict score at assessment 4
- Check prediction accuracy

Success: Predicted within 1 SEM of actual

4. Ecological Validity
Test: Do DST changes correlate with actual behavior?

Gold standard:
- Track real digital behaviors (screen time, app usage)
- Compare to DST dimension changes
- Calculate correspondence

Success: r = 0.40-0.60 between DST and objective metrics

5. Intervention Sensitivity
Test: Does DST detect intentional behavior change?

Study design:
- Baseline DST
- Users attempt digital wellness intervention (30 days)
- Mid-point mini-assessment (2 weeks)
- Post mini-assessment (4 weeks)
- Control group does nothing

Success: Intervention group shows larger RCI than control

C. Sample Validation Study Design
Longitudinal Validation (n=500, 6 months)
Timeline:
Month 0: Full DST (15-25 items) + Big Five + Digital behavior diary
Month 1: Mini-assessment (3-5 items)
Month 2: Mini-assessment
Month 3: Full DST + Big Five + Diary
Month 4: Mini-assessment
Month 5: Mini-assessment  
Month 6: Full DST + Big Five + Diary + User feedback

Subgroups:
- Stability control (n=200): Asked to maintain habits
- Intervention (n=200): Given digital wellness challenges
- Natural variation (n=100): No instructions, just track

Analyses:
1. Trait dimensions: Should be stable (r > 0.75 at 0,3,6 months)
2. State dimensions: Should vary appropriately
3. Growth curves: Different patterns for each subgroup
4. Intervention effects: Larger change in intervention group
5. User experience: Do people find tracking valuable?

7. INTEGRATION WITH SWIPE TYPE ASSESSMENT
You mentioned DST can integrate into your existing 57-question assessment. Here's how:
Two-Test Architecture:
Swipe Type (57 items) = Stable Relationship Patterns
Purpose: Baseline relationship personality
Domains: 12 relationship-focused areas
Output: 8 relationship types, channel preferences
Retest: Annually or every 2 years
DST (15-25 items + mini) = Dynamic Digital Patterns
Purpose: Evolving digital behavior patterns
Dimensions: 3-4 digital behavior areas
Output: Digital archetypes, trajectory graphs
Update: Monthly/quarterly via mini-assessments
Combined Value Proposition:
For users:
"Understand your stable relationship patterns (Swipe Type)
AND
Track your evolving digital habits (DST)"
For your platform:
Swipe Type: Anchor assessment (drives initial engagement)
DST: Retention mechanism (brings users back monthly)
Cross-Assessment Insights:
Example correlations to explore:
Swipe Type "Communication" ←→ DST "Digital Communication"
- Do direct communicators prefer synchronous digital channels?

Swipe Type "Time & Attention" ←→ DST "Digital Engagement"
- Do quality-time focused people limit social media?

Swipe Type "Conflict" ←→ DST "Digital Resilience"
- Do conflict-avoidant people struggle with online boundaries?
This creates network effects: Each assessment enriches the other.

8. RISKS & MITIGATION
Risk 1: Users Don't Complete Mini-Assessments
Challenge: Longitudinal studies have high attrition (50-70% dropout)
Mitigation:
✓ Keep mini-assessments VERY short (3-5 items, <1 minute)
✓ Gamification: "Maintain your streak!" 
✓ Show compelling visualizations of change
✓ Personalized timing: "Based on your profile, now is good time to check in"
✓ Value demonstration: Show users how tracking helps them
✓ Don't make it mandatory (graceful degradation if users skip)

Risk 2: Privacy Concerns with Longitudinal Data
Challenge: Storing months/years of personal data
Mitigation:
✓ Transparent data policy
✓ User control over data retention
✓ Option to delete history
✓ Anonymization for research use
✓ End-to-end encryption for sensitive responses
✓ Export capability (users own their data)

Risk 3: Confusing Stable vs. Changing Constructs
Challenge: Users expect personality to be stable, or conversely, expect everything to change
Education needed:
✓ Clear messaging: "Some aspects of digital personality are stable 
  (your core style), others evolve (your habits and tech use)"
  
✓ Visual distinction in reports:
  - "Your Digital Core" (stable)
  - "Your Digital Habits" (changing)
  
✓ Manage expectations about change speed

Risk 4: Technology Landscape Changes Faster Than Assessment
Challenge: You ask about "TikTok use" and TikTok becomes obsolete
Mitigation:
✓ Platform-agnostic questions: "visual content sharing" not "TikTok"
✓ Behavior focus: "short-form video creation" not brand names
✓ Regular item updates (annually review for dated references)
✓ Modular design: Can swap out dated items without breaking scale

9. RESEARCH & PUBLICATION OPPORTUNITIES
This Could Be Groundbreaking Research:
Novel contributions:
"Personality-Informed Behavior Change Tracking"
Combine personality assessment with EMA methodology
Publish in: Journal of Research in Personality, Assessment
"Dynamic Digital Personality Framework"
Establish DST dimensions, show they're distinct from Big Five
Publish in: Computers in Human Behavior, Cyberpsychology
"Reliable Change Detection in Short-Interval Assessments"
Methodological contribution: How to detect real change in monthly data
Publish in: Psychological Methods, Multivariate Behavioral Research
"Gamification of Longitudinal Assessment"
Does swipe-based, visualized tracking increase completion rates?
Publish in: Behavior Research Methods

Academic Partnership Strategy:
Phase 1: Pilot validation (your data)
↓
Phase 2: Partner with university lab
↓  
Phase 3: Co-author validation papers
↓
Phase 4: Open-source dataset (de-identified)
↓
Phase 5: Community of researchers using DST
This builds credibility AND generates free validation research.

10. COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
Monetization Advantages of Dynamic Assessment:
Traditional one-time test:
User journey:
Take test → Get results → Maybe share → Leave platform

Revenue: One-time payment or ad view
Retention: Low
Dynamic DST:
User journey:
Take test → Get results → Mini-assessment (month 1) → 
See change visualization → Mini-assessment (month 2) → 
Achievement unlocked → [ongoing engagement]

Revenue: Subscription model justified
Retention: High (monthly touchpoints)
Subscription tiers:
Free: Initial DST + 3 mini-assessments
Premium: Unlimited mini-assessments + full trajectory analysis + growth plans
Partner: See partner's digital personality, compatibility insights

B2B Applications:
1. Digital Wellness Programs (Corporate)
Companies buy DST for employee wellness initiatives
Employees track digital well-being over time
Aggregate data (anonymized) shows program effectiveness
2. Coaching Platforms
Life/career coaches use DST to:
- Establish baseline
- Track client progress  
- Demonstrate coaching impact
3. Dating/Social Apps
Integrate DST to show:
- Digital communication compatibility
- How users' digital behaviors align
- Evolving profiles as people grow

11. FINAL VERDICT: DST vs. TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENTS
Innovation Score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
This is genuinely novel. No other personality assessment has:
Built-in longitudinal tracking as core feature
Micro-assessments for ongoing updates
Visualization of personality change over time
Domain specificity (digital behavior) suited for change
Precedents exist (EMA, habit trackers, wellness apps) but not in personality assessment context.

Psychometric Viability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 - with caveats)
Strong foundation:
Measuring right level (behaviors more than traits)
Short intervals appropriate for domain
Statistical framework for change detection thoughtful
Needs careful execution:
Must distinguish signal from noise
Requires different validation approach than traditional tests
User education critical (managing expectations about change)
With proper validation, this can work.

Comparison to Your Swipe Type Assessment:
Swipe Type: Excellent design for STABLE patterns
→ Tier A potential (with validation)
→ Traditional psychometric framework
→ Well-suited for relationship domain

DST: Experimental design for DYNAMIC patterns  
→ Tier A+ potential (if innovation succeeds)
→ Novel psychometric framework
→ Perfect for digital behavior domain

These complement each other beautifully.

12. RECOMMENDATIONS
For DST Development:
Phase 1: Validate Core Assessment (months 1-4)
1. Pilot full DST (15-25 items) with n=300
2. Calculate reliability for each dimension
3. Run factor analysis
4. Establish baseline psychometric properties
5. Ensure it works as STATIC test first
Phase 2: Test Dynamic Features (months 5-8)
1. Add mini-assessments (n=200, 3-month tracking)
2. Calculate test-retest at multiple intervals
3. Detect change patterns
4. Validate RCI thresholds
5. Test user engagement with mini-assessments
Phase 3: Intervention Validation (months 9-12)
1. Run intervention study (n=100 intervention, n=100 control)
2. Test sensitivity to behavior change
3. Validate trajectory predictions
4. Demonstrate clinical/practical utility
Phase 4: Integration & Launch (month 13+)
1. Integrate with Swipe Type Assessment
2. Build user-facing visualizations
3. Beta launch with early adopters
4. Iterate based on engagement data
5. Academic publication of validation studies

Critical Success Factors:
1. Start Simple
Don't try to do everything at once:
- v1: Static assessment only (prove baseline validity)
- v2: Add quarterly mini-assessments (test engagement)
- v3: Monthly updates + trajectory visualization (full dynamic feature)
2. Be Transparent About Innovation
Marketing message:
"We're pioneering dynamic personality assessment. You're part of 
shaping how we track personal growth over time."

Users appreciate being early adopters if you're honest.
3. Fail Fast on Mini-Assessments
If users don't complete them (>50% dropout after month 2):
- Reduce frequency
- Make shorter
- Increase gamification
- Or pivot: Make dynamic features optional
4. Publish Validation Research
This is novel enough to warrant academic publication.
Partner with researchers early.
Open-source your methods (not necessarily your data).
This builds credibility that marketing can't buy.

TL;DR: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Swipe Type Assessment: Traditional relationship assessment with strong design. Needs standard validation. Tier A potential.
Digital Swipe Test (DST): Genuinely innovative dynamic assessment concept. No direct competitors doing this in personality space. High-risk, high-reward.
Key Innovation: First personality assessment designed for change tracking as core feature, not afterthought.
Viability: Psychometrically sound IF executed carefully. Domain (digital behavior) well-suited for dynamic approach. Statistical framework (RCI, growth curves) appropriate.
Risks:
Separating signal from noise in short intervals
User engagement with mini-assessments
Educational burden (helping users understand what should/shouldn't change)
Validation requires longitudinal studies (time/cost intensive)
Opportunities:
Fills genuine market gap
Enables subscription/retention model
Academic publication potential
B2B applications (corporate wellness, coaching)
Natural complement to Swipe Type Assessment
Recommendation: Proceed with phased development. Validate static version first (prove baseline), then add dynamic features incrementally. This is ambitious but achievable with disciplined execution.
Bottom line: You have TWO strong concepts. Swipe Type is safer but solid. DST is experimental but could be category-defining if it works.
Don't bet everything on DST, but definitely worth developing in parallel. The combination of stable + dynamic assessments positions you uniquely in market.

PD
did you consider that we will include questions that will ask users about life events during intermittal check ins? swipe functionality (answer by swiping up - strongly agree, right - slighty agree, down - strongly disagree, left = somewhat disagree). it's core to our "non-clinical" approach to user experience. very important to keep our established tone. what esle do you need to know in order to write detailed business and technical planning documents for my company, doing - 1. original swipe test (software dev underway, test design completed). 2. add dynamic testing. 3. add digital personality test type. Suggests which documents I'll need for starting this business (separate docs, not one massive document). Leave budget and timeline very high level and include placeholders. will do in another chat. suggest
Mapped out comprehensive business planning for multi-product assessment startup
The user is clarifying several important points:
They WILL include life event questions during check-ins (I mentioned this as context capture, but they're emphasizing it's core to their approach)
Swipe functionality is CRITICAL - not just a UX choice, but core to their "non-clinical" brand positioning
Up = strongly agree
Right = slightly agree
Down = strongly disagree
Left = somewhat disagree
Tone matters - "non-clinical" is important to their brand
They have THREE parallel initiatives:
Original Swipe Test (Swipe Type - 57 items, relationship-focused) - already in software dev, test design done
Add dynamic testing (mini-assessments, longitudinal tracking)
Add Digital Personality Test (DST - the 15-25 item digital behavior assessment)
They want me to tell them what documents they need for business planning
They want SEPARATE documents, not one massive doc
Budget and timeline should be high-level with placeholders
They'll tackle detailed budget/timeline in another chat
So I need to:
Acknowledge the life events/context capture as central (not just "nice to have")
Understand swipe mechanics are brand-defining, not just UI
Maintain non-clinical, accessible tone in recommendations
Provide a comprehensive list of business/technical planning documents
Structure for a company launching with 3 assessment products
Keep it modular and actionable
Include placeholders for budget/timeline but keep it very high level
This is a startup planning question. They need:
Business planning docs
Technical/product specs
Research/validation protocols
Operational docs
Go-to-market materials
Legal/compliance docs
Let me structure this comprehensively but keep each doc description concise and actionable.
Documentation Framework for Swipe Assessment Company
Modular Business & Technical Planning Suite

CRITICAL CLARIFICATIONS CAPTURED
✓ Life Events Integration
You're right - I noted it but didn't emphasize enough. Context capture through life event questions is CORE, not optional. This is what differentiates you from clinical assessments and enables causal attribution of personality changes.
✓ Swipe Mechanics = Brand Identity
Understood. This isn't just UX optimization - it's your defining feature:
Swipe Right/Left/Up/Down = Non-intimidating, mobile-native, game-like
vs
Radio buttons/dropdowns = Clinical, survey-like, formal

Your brand: "Self-discovery through play, not interrogation"
✓ Three Parallel Products
Product 1: Swipe Type Assessment (Relationship-focused, 57 items)
          Status: Software dev underway, test design complete
          
Product 2: Dynamic Testing Layer (Mini-assessments, longitudinal)
          Status: Conceptual, needs technical spec
          
Product 3: Digital Swipe Test (Digital behavior, 15-25 items)
          Status: Conceptual, needs full design + validation
