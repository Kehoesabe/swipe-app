# Chat Index — SWIPE

> Titles are clean; the **Model** column tracks who led the session: GPT (ChatGPT), CLD (Claude), MIX (shared).  
> Dates use **DD Mon**. Fill placeholders once you have sidebar/export info.  
> Keep each Focus to one line.

- Use **CrossRef** for overlaps/merged threads.
- When you rename chats in-app, mirror the finalized titles here.
