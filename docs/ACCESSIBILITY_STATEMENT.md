We want everyone to be able to use Swipe Type. Our goal is to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards. We're continually improving accessibility as we build and test.

## Current Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard navigation:** All interactive elements can be reached and activated with a keyboard.
- **Screen reader compatibility:** Descriptive labels, headings, and roles for UI controls and results.
- **Color contrast:** We aim for WCAG AA contrast ratios throughout the app and website.
- **Focus indicators:** Visible focus outlines and logical focus order.
- **Semantics:** Structural HTML, landmark regions, and ARIA where appropriate.
- **Alt text:** Informative alternative text for images and icons (or marked decorative).

## Known Issues & Roadmap
- Gesture-heavy interactions (swipe) include keyboard and button alternatives.
- We are improving reduced-motion preferences in animations.
- Ongoing audits to ensure consistent labels and roles across new components.

If you find a problem not listed here, please let us know.
