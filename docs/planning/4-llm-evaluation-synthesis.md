# 4-LLM EVALUATION SYNTHESIS

**AI Coordination:** For current multi-LLM workflow coordination, see [Multi-LLM Coordination](../MULTI_LLM_COORDINATION.md).

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
All 4 LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Google AI, Gemini) evaluated Swipe Type MVP design.

**Consensus Rating:** 8.5/10 - "Remarkably sophisticated and psychometrically sound"

**Universal Agreement:**
‚úÖ Strong psychometric foundation (within-person z-scoring, quality flags)
‚úÖ Intellectual honesty (acknowledges limitations, avoids false claims)
‚úÖ Excellent documentation quality
üî¥ **72 items CRITICAL** for reliability (unanimous recommendation)
üî¥ **Axis formulas under-specified** (must document before implementation)

## KEY STRENGTHS (All LLMs Agree)

### 1. Scoring Philosophy: Best-in-Class
- Within-person normalization controls acquiescence bias
- Continuous-first approach (types as interpretive layer)
- Quality flags (low variance, speeding, skips)
- **Superior to 95% of commercial personality tests**

### 2. Intellectual Honesty: Outstanding
**What design explicitly rejects:**
- ‚ùå Ipsative/forced-choice (learned from Love Languages)
- ‚ùå MBTI dichotomization (learned from bimodality fallacy)
- ‚ùå Claims without validation
- ‚ùå Diagnostic or hiring applications

**What design acknowledges:**
- Channels are "interpretive aggregates, not latent factors"
- Types are summaries, not diagnostic categories
- Provisional norms labeled clearly
- "Starting point, not diagnosis" framing

### 3. Documentation: Implementation-Ready
- Clear notation and formulas
- Explicit implementation steps
- Version control built in
- Non-negotiables stated upfront

## CRITICAL ISSUES (All LLMs Agree)

### üî¥ ISSUE #1: Items-Per-Domain Ratio
**Problem:** 57 items √∑ 12 domains = 4.75 avg/domain

**Impact on Reliability:**
- 3 items ‚Üí Œ± = 0.55-0.65 (unacceptable)
- 4 items ‚Üí Œ± = 0.65-0.72 (marginal)
- 5 items ‚Üí Œ± = 0.72-0.78 (acceptable)
- **6 items ‚Üí Œ± = 0.78-0.85 (good)** ‚Üê Target

**Recommendation (UNANIMOUS):**
**Expand to 72 items (6 per domain)**
- Adds ~1 minute completion time (acceptable with swipe)
- Reliability is non-negotiable
- Easier to remove items later than add

**Direct Quotes:**
- Claude: "Go to 72 items... reliability is non-negotiable"
- ChatGPT: "CRITICAL ISSUE... most robust path forward"
- Google AI: "strongly recommended"
- Gemini: "most direct way to resolve reliability issue"

### üî¥ ISSUE #2: Axis Formula Under-Specified
