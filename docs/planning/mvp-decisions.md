## PSYCHOMETRIC
- 72 items total (6 per domain)
- Equal-weight axis formulas documented
- Within-person z-scoring (σ clipped to 0.40 min)
- Quality flags: low variance, speeding, high skip rate
- No percentiles until n=500 (use z-scores or High/Med/Low)

Axis 2 = avg(Time, Service, Gifts, Affection, Energy, Growth)

## TYPES (8)
From 2x2 axis quadrants + confidence scoring

## MVP SCOPE
