#### Dynamic Test Model (Ongoing Assessment)
- **Status:** Planned (Post-MVP Phase 3)
- **Documentation:** `docs/dynamic-test-model.md` ‚úÖ CREATED
- **Key Concepts:**
  - "Rolling profile" - personality evolves over time
  - Periodic check-ins (mini-assessments: 3-5 questions)
  - Life event triggers (job change, relationship status, major life events)
  - Longitudinal tracking (personality change visualization)
  - Adaptive questioning based on previous responses
- **Dependencies:** 
  - User authentication system
  - Historical data storage
  - Analytics for change detection
- **Priority:** High (differentiator feature)

- **Documentation:** NONE YET ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Computerized Adaptive Testing
  - Branching logic based on responses
  - Shorter, more accurate assessments
  - Item Response Theory (IRT)
- **Dependencies:** Large validation dataset, IRT expertise
- **Priority:** Low (complex, uncertain ROI)

---

### 4. USER EXPERIENCE

#### Reassessment Features

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING DOCUMENTATION

**Need to Create:**
1. `adaptive-testing.md` - CAT research and approach
2. `reassessment-features.md` - User re-testing flows

**‚úÖ Created:**
1. `digital-personality-types.md` - DST specification
2. `dynamic-test-model.md` - Ongoing testing system

**Action Items:**
- [ ] User to provide previous DST documentation
- [ ] User to provide previous Dynamic Testing documentation
- [ ] Claude to create artifacts for future reference
- [ ] Integrate into main roadmap

## üîÑ UPDATE PROTOCOL

**When adding new features:**
1. Add entry to this index
2. Create dedicated doc in `docs/`
3. Update priority matrix
4. Link to related features
5. Note dependencies
6. Commit with message: `docs(features): add [FEATURE_NAME] to index`

**Before ending any planning session:**
- [ ] Review discussions for new features
- [ ] Ask: "Should this become an artifact/document?"
- [ ] Update this index
- [ ] Create placeholder docs for missing items

## üìç CURRENT STATE

**MVP (In Progress):**
- Individual Swipe Type Assessment (57 questions)
- Basic scoring algorithm (being validated)
- Premium report ($12)
- Results screens

**Phase 0 (Current Focus):**
- Academic validation of scoring
- Test data generation
- Benchmark creation

**Next Phase (After MVP Launch):**
- Couples compatibility OR
- Dynamic testing foundation

---

## üí° NOTES

- Dynamic Testing is a **differentiator** - most personality tests are static
- DST creates an **ecosystem** (relationship + digital personality)
- Adaptive Testing is **nice-to-have** but complex and risky
- Focus on **high-value, achievable** features first

## üìö DOCUMENTATION ADDED (2025-10-09)

### Reference Archives
- `test-scoring-methods.md` - How LL/EN/MBTI/Big5 score (reference only)

### Future Scope (Expanded)
- `digital-personality-types.md` - DST specification (expanded from previous)
- `dynamic-test-model.md` - Ongoing assessment design (expanded from previous)

**Status:** Templates ready for content
